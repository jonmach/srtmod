1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,151
SUNDAY 7:30 A.M.

2
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,836
Alex?

3
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,558
All's quiet. Come on in.
- OK, thanks.

4
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,430
OK, you know the order.
Stay focussed.

5
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,238
Right. We've got
100 minutes from now.

6
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,678
Stop, stop.

7
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,835
OK, go.

8
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,078
Headlamps off.

9
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,557
81 minutes left.

10
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,473
35.

11
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,834
Ready.

12
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,552
420.

13
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,154
312.
- Ready.

14
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,509
456.

15
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,399
Ready.

16
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,312
151.

17
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,878
We said no stocks and bonds.
Just cash and jewellery.

18
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,470
Fuck! We can't leave all this loot!
- You're done. Move.

19
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,993
31 minutes left.

20
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,234
Get the syringe with novocaine.
Come on.

21
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,197
Get him out of here.
Let's go.

22
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,709
We've got six minutes left.
Come on. Move it!

23
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,552
Fuckin' hell, we did it!

24
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,948
EEN AND SKYLINE ENTERTAINMENT
PRESENT

25
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,513
WITH THE SUPPORT OF

26
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,314
THE FLANDERS
AUDIOVISUAL FUND / MEDIA FUND

27
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,078
No, there's too much. I'm sorry.

28
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,957
I can't take everything,
it's out of the question.

29
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,518
So make me an offer.
- Make you an offer? OK. I'll...

30
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,355
I'll just take the diamonds.
And the necklaces.

31
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,992
And I suggest you smelt the gold and
come back and see me in December.

32
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,639
You only want cash.
I can't have any for you before then.

33
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,709
How much?

34
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,198
600,000 euro. In cash.

35
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,759
That's all I can give you at the moment.

36
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,679
That's 24 million old Belgian francs.

37
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,835
I think it's a fair offer.

38
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,795
Given the circumstances.

39
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,039
OK, I accept.

40
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,869
OK.

41
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,314
Was there something else?

42
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,148
No. No, no. Take it. I...

43
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:45,558
I just thought that maybe you could...

44
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,394
I thought about that too.

45
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,552
No one would know.

46
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,350
MONDAY 8:00 A.M.

47
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,475
Morning, Sylvia.
- Good morning, Mr Robijns.

48
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,629
Good weekend? I was stuck in traffic for
an hour, make my coffee extra strong.

49
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,751
Your mail, Mr Robijns.
- I'll just turn the alarm off first.

50
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,719
Fuck!

51
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,199
Christ!

52
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,439
Oh, fuck!

53
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,553
Jesus Christ!

54
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,397
The stocks and bonds are still there.
- Yes.

55
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,997
I can see that too.

56
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,192
How many safes have been opened?
- 66.

57
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,279
Bloody hell! I was afraid of that.

58
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,354
Shit!

59
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,794
It would have to be
the 66 sensitive safes.

60
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,315
Mr Jonkhere...
shouldn't we call the police?

61
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,112
Let me think.

62
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,269
Did Sylvia notice anything?
- No.

63
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,755
Did you tell her anything?
- No.

64
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,473
Send her home.

65
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,592
What? Sylvia is the first person
the police will want to question.

66
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,554
There won't be any police.
D'you think this is a coincidence?

67
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,319
All that work. Just for those 66 safes.

68
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,074
No one else is coming in here today.
Think of an excuse.

69
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,635
The computer's crashed, for example.

70
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,999
By this evening
I want a list of all personnel

71
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,318
who know the identity of
the safes' owners.

72
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,711
There's a traitor in our midst.

73
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,794
A spy.

74
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,033
There has to be.

75
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,954
Bye, Mr Robijns.
- See you tomorrow, Sylvia.

76
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,639
Can you put the bins out, sweetheart?
And the shopping list is on the fridge.

77
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,272
Don't spoil my day off.
- Come on, I have to go to work.

78
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,189
I worked 32 hours this weekend.
- I know, darling.
